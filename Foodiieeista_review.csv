We happened to be around the Christmas time, and it couldn't get any more prettier. They also provided us with an individual heater in the biting cold. The food is great too.

Indoor seating is rustic English interiors in their signature blue nd pink theme. We ordered Mediterranean vegetables and pesto Rose cafe Melt which is basically an open sandwich.

But the long ques din't make it happen then. After the CP outlet opened I finally made it here. I had ordered paneer king which made me feel this place was over hyped since the burger was ordinary.. nd so did my friend felt about the chicken whopper, but the chilli cheezos were really nice along with the sweet chilli dip. The chocolate shake too was pretty good. My 1st experience was overall great..so I further tried their other burgers when burger king became prevlant in nearly every food court in delhi..the bk veggie, chilli cheese...all of them were good and a change from the McDonald's burgers too.

Dal makhani and paneer makhani were so delicious and the naans perfect n crisp. The tawa vegetable pulao was subtle and packed with flavourful spices. The service was quick and the staff very polite. The ambience made it even more interesting with catchy slogans and peppy bollywood numbers to add to the dhaba feel. Only the huge taxes were a little pinching but a great experience. I really regret not coming to this place before while being in dlf.",Dhaba - Estd 1986 Delhi,28.5275143790,77.2169009596
305198,https://www.zomato.com/ncr/angels-in-my-kitchen-dlf-cyber-city-gurgaon,1,Visited this place on Christmas and it was beautifully decorated. The butter cream cupcake was delicious just as it looked. The multi grain sandwich was healthy and fresh. The Interiors were cute. Due to the heavy rush the staff was having a hard time serving and changed my chocolate cupcake to vanilla. The brownie bar box was the best pick for me. It was one of the best brownie's I have had with a beautiful texture and glaze on top. I also got vegetable and mushroom patties packed. The flavour was soo good with even soft layers unlike those paper flaky patties. The other one was full of creamy mushroom and tasted like Alfredo sauce within. The Chocolate truffle was mind blowing. Amazing...read more,Angels in my Kitchen,28.4960991609,77.0889401436

Eating until flag down is worth every penny and self brushing the skewers gives a personalised touch too. My experience at saket outlet felt a little lacking in comparison to other outlets. We had reached earlier than the time booked for but got a seat well in time. It was heavily crowded due to the disco carnival and people standing on the head surrounding the table felt irritating. The valet service was convenient. The service seemed slower and we had to either wait for the servings or call the waiters. The crunchy fried corn, pineapple and mushroom tikkas are just amazing.

The patties rolls and pastries are very soft fresh and unbeatable. I tried their macroons for the first tym. Orange was the only variety available that day. They were nicely layered and tasted good. The walnut tart too was great. The vegetable baguette was very light and crisp. Only the chaos at this place gets irritating at times due to the small area, but it is worth it.",Wenger's,28.6334507026,77.2180680558
256,https://www.zomato.com/ncr/pizza-hut-1-saket-new-delhi,1,Pizza hut has always been a place one can never say no to. But in the past few months it seems to have deteriorated. Their focus on innovative pizzas and crusts has diverted them from the quality they used to maintain. Dine in is any day better than pizza hut delivery so I'm posting some of my unpleasant home delivery experiences. The giant box was a disaster for me. The potatoe bites were mccain. The garlic bread sticks dry. Pizzas horrible nd cold. Waste of money... the next tym they refused to deliver baked pasta. Kurkure pizza was okayish. Not worth another try. Chilli cheese base pizza was reduced in size and hardly had any filling like it used to have when this base was launched....read more,Pizza Hut,28.5230377106,77.2078840435

I ordered for home delivery falefal pita and khasta kabab salad which took about 1 hour to deliver. Sadly they changed it on their own to hummus pita but the taste made up for it. The pita was excellent with even filling inside. The hummus spread was so gud. The salad was fresh as if u were eating a healthy pasta. The dressing and spice were just perfect.,Pita Pit,28.5295141926,77.2194242477

Most of the waffles weren't available which was a disappointment. So I settled with Richie rich. In terms of taste this place has no issues..the waffles are great, beautiful looking and generous with chocolate. Even the marshmallow waffle iv tried previously and it ws divine.
Only think u might feel is that it's not that price worth .. the one fourth waffle portion is vry little as per the pricing. Also they don't have packing facility which was a minus for me.
Overall this place is great and a must try for a perfect sweet ending.",Drool Waffles,28.5295268589,77.2194249183
