It seems to be over-hyped as the food was highly disappointing and not at all worth spending time there. Cold cuts tasted raw, they had grill section and even after requesting steak to be well done, it was rare. Indian section starters (kebabs) were all dried up and tough to be consumed. Staff at the Indian & Chinese section was not bothered and didn't want to attend any customers. They seemed to be busy amongst themselves.
