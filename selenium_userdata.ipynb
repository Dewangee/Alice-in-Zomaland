We chose the buffet spread that had a set menu but unlimited quantities. Starting with Smoked chili prawns, these were served with red chilies, tasted decent enough but the chilies served along looked totally waste as couldn't dare to taste them.

With a seating of hardly 20 people the cafe is well done with wooden casual interiors and a feedback wall thing that is very common with the south campus cafes. Wasting no time and taking suggestions seriously we ordered a chicken ceaser salad and a Mother of Chicken burger along with an oreo milkshake. The food arrived in quick succession and I must say that the salad was one of the most creamiest one I've ever had and I recommend it to each and everyone.

Located near the food court on DLF Place mall in saket the place is this American diner and tex mex cuisine restaurant that I would say hasn't received its due in the Indian restaurant market because lack of clientele has lead them to introduce multiple course buffet at 199++. Trust me the place deserves much more than that. The interiors I would say have been kept a bit dim and casual approach but those little tag lines do bring a smile to your face.

So I got myself 1/2 chatpati chaap roll and 1/2 malai chaap roll packed. The portions considering the price are decent and the packaging too was done pretty well. Mint chutney and onions were provided in abundant quantity despite the sudden rise in price of onions. The chaap too tasted decent but nothing over the top. The rumali roti was rolled in such a manner that made the filling invisible from both ends that somehow turned me off. Recommend their chaap tikka instead avoid rolls. I'm coming back...read more\n",
