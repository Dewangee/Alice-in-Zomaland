1777,https://www.zomato.com/ncr/rajinder-da-dhaba-safdarjung-new-delhi,1,Rajinder Da dhaba is the best place for people who crave indian kebabs and tikkas. They serve undoubtedly the best. Either you can stand outside and eat or you can dine in. The dine in is a bit more expensive and its not worth it. Now lets come to the food. The best dish is the MUTTON GALAUTI KEBAB it is so soft it will melt in your mouth. Chicken Burra and Chicken Satay are really good too. The masala of Burra Chicken is nothing like i have eaten before very mouth watering and amazing. Chicken seekh roll is good to the seekh was very tender. The only problem is the parking if you plan on going late at around 10 you wont find any.,Rajinder Da Dhaba,28.5655299661,77.1992550418

One where you get frozen snacks the other is the Sardar Inland china. At the frozen section you get a variety of snacks like Chicken Orly ,Chilli Chicken , Chicken Khus Seekh , Chicken 65 ,Chicken tandoori tikka , Drums of heaven and many more. It also has its own packings of seekh kabab , chicken salami which are simply mouth watering. From the frozen snacks Chicken Orly is a must try ,Chicken Tikki and Chicken khus seekh are the best. I lately tried the Chicken nuggets due to some reason I didnt like it. On the whole if you live in ashok vihar you should give this place a try.",Sardar A Pure Meat Shop,28.6872438345,77.1730166674

They also have freshly made croissants available. You can also grab a quick bite if you feel hungry. They have the square shaped chicken patties(trust me the best chick patty available).
