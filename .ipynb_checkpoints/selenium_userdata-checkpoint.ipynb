A unique concept of nitrogen ice creams made live before u. The flavours are numerous with lovely combinations to choose from. The additional toppings and sauces are soo tempting. I tried coffee toffee at first with an extra caramel sauce and oreo crumle as snicker snacker was unavailable. I must say i fell for it the very first bite. It was a beautiful creamy smooth texture, very unlikely for just an ice cream to make u go wow. The coffee flavour came up so rich..even a starbucks coffee can't match that. Additional sauces might make the ice cream...read more\n",

The kullad chai was steaming hot and so aromatic. Also the numerous options for customizing your tea is unique. Really liked the concept. I not being a tea person opted for kiwi shake which had a very mild flavour not really like a shake though but was refreshing as they say it's absolutely natural content that goes in. The paneer sambossa was too tiny but again had a nice spicy taste to compliment ur tea munching. The staff was very sweet and offered the regular tea in kullads too.

The service was quick and the staff very polite. The ambience made it even more interesting with catchy slogans and peppy bollywood numbers to add to the dhaba feel.

The Interiors were cute. Due to the heavy rush the staff was having a hard time serving and changed my chocolate cupcake to vanilla. The brownie bar box was the best pick for me. It was one of the best brownie's I have had with a beautiful texture and glaze on top. I also got vegetable and mushroom patties packed. The flavour was soo good with even soft layers unlike those paper flaky patties. The other one was full of creamy mushroom and tasted like Alfredo sauce within.

I had been wanting to try ravioli for long and my wait was worth it.. we had ravioli wid cream and parmesan..the spinach filling inside and the sauce, were great. Also the bread along was so soft. The spinach and mushroom lasagne is smthng to die for. One of the best things to order. Coming to the desserts...it's equally a heaven...read more\", 1], 'https://www.zomato.com/ncr/fatburger-dlf-cyber-city-gurgaon': [\"It was my first visit to this place and it turned out to be absolutely amazing. Good ambience and polite staff..\\nI ordered green apple lemonade which was very refreshing. The vegetarian platter was great.. the fat'z mozzarella, onion rings and potatoe skins with 4 kinds of dips were sooo good but the southwest rolls were okayish.\\nIt was quite filling still we tried the roasted Chipotle burger which was one of the best burgers iv had.. it's value for money and m surely going to visit this place again to try their other varieties of burgers.\", 1], 'https://www.zomato.com/ncr/drool-waffles-saket-new-delhi': [\"I wanted to try savoury waffles, but in the food court outlet I was told they were only available in the ground floor outlet.. Most of the waffles weren't available which was a disappointment. So I settled with Richie rich. In terms of taste this place has no issues..the waffles are great, beautiful looking and generous with chocolate. Even the marshmallow waffle iv tried previously and it ws divine.\\nOnly think u might feel is that it's not that price worth .. the one fourth waffle portion is vry little as per the pricing. Also they don't have packing facility which was a minus for me.\\nOverall this place is great and a must try for a perfect sweet ending.\", 1], 'https://www.zomato.com/ncr/cinnabon-saket-new-delhi': [\"A boon for people having sweet tooth. The chocolate and red velvet cupcakes are outstanding. One of the best u will find in Delhi. The Chocobon tastes lyk any chocolate donut..but the pecanbon is something to die for. It's a must have.

After so much of hype I finally decided to try gulatis, little knowing my dinner would turn into a disaster. First of all the service was terrible.. we had to call the waiters thrice to clean our tables..they dint evn bother to change the cutlery after the snacks for the main course nd napkins had to be requested too. Coming to the food.... a local street shop wud serve u better stuff..the snacks were routine..nthng unique about the platter. Dal maknhi was bland n tasteless. Malai kofta tasted burnt and amritsari kulchas which are mentioned as chefs specials in the menu were full of spice less boiled potatoes only oozing butter.
