      "Some days you want to have something light and different. With this on my mind I went through the Curry company menu and Masala khichdi and hing Pudina Masala Alloo was something I really wanted to try as this was something different with phirni for Dessert. While my colleague asked for Malai murg tikka. Loved the amazing flavor and spices in the Khichdi, the hing Pudina alloo was something very different a bit spicy and great on mint, hing and green chilli flavor tasting great. Malai murg was soft & juicy and light on spices. Phirni was good too though quantity was less, probably sufficient for 1 but not 2.\n",
