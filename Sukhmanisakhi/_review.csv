A humble little corner serving a limited menu of street food items with flavours that will stay with you forever and I can swear by them in saying that these cannot be replicated by any other outlet anywhere in the world. Personally I have never eaten better chaat anywhere else, be it Delhi, Mumbai or any other city in India. Made with a small sitting, Brij Wasi is ever bustling in the evenings with flocks of cars waiting in the parking, honking for more plates of addictive dishes that they serve. It's best to order and eat inside the car, the servers mostly...read more",Brijwasi Chat Bhandar,31.6349533000,74.8758921000

The Chicken Tikka is among the good ones with extremely moist and melt in the mouth chicken bits with a spicy seasoning. Chicken Shawarma is chunky, spicy and so good when dunked into the creamy mayonnaise. Makes for the perfect meal. Paneer Tawa is deliciously and rich but can be made to order with less grease.
